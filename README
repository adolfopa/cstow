CStow is a software package management tool.  Essentially, it is a
simplified clone of GNU Stow.  The main differences between GNU Stow
and CStow are:

  1. CStow is implemented in C with almost no external dependencies.
  It should compile in any POSIX system out of the box (if it doesn't,
  it is a bug!).

  2. CStow will never create symbolic links for directories when
  installing packages; only files will be symlinked.  This behaviour
  is intentional.

  3. Some GNU Stow options aren't supported by CStow (-d, -t, -R, -V),
  and only the short form of each option is recognised.

The lack of dependencies makes CStow useful when you want to use GNU
Stow but aren't allowed to (or don't want to) install Perl on the
system.  Also, as CStow doesn't symlink directories, it works well in
conjunction with other tools like FreeBSD ports o NetBSD pkgsrc; this
way, you can have all your local software in /usr/local instead of
having multiple local trees.

If you don't mind having Perl around, or don't use other package
management tools that might have problems with symlinked directories,
you shouldn't use CStow; GNU Stow is more mature and featureful.
